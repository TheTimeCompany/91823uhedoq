# Jekyll + GH Pages

I had already mentioned beforehand about the Jekyll and GitHub Pages combo. What is it? And who is it best suited for?

Simple.

If you are a developer, especially someone who focuses on the web aspect often, then this "blogging system" can be a perfect fit for you. This option is also for people who wish to have the power of **manual customization** in their own hands.

There are plenty of themes available, too. So you do not have to start from scratch. On the official [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/), you shall find the relevant links.

GitHub Pages also provides a free SSL if you can configure it correctly.

The whole system can run on the cloud (as a repository on GitHub) or even locally in your device or webserver.

# MuxSites via Sawpman

Okay, this is not an official "blogging platform" yet, but you can certainly contact us or  [MuxSites](https://www.muxsites.com) to order a free blogging site.

Usually MuxSites (operated by MuxWorks) does not provide nor build blogsites on their Free Plan, but with the exception of Sawpman you can order up a custom blogging platform just MADE FOR YOU!

The only drawback/catch would be that you would be using **[yoursitename].sawpmansite.com** as a subdomain instead of **[yoursitename].muxsites.com**, which does not seem like a big difference since they both are subdomains rented out for free.

To order, simply contact  [me](https://instagram.com/dewanmukto)  or  [Sawpman](https://instagram.com/sawpman)  on Instagram.

A special deal between MuxSites and Sawpman ensures that you can reap extra benefits by being a **#SawpmanSupporter** or **#SawpmanFan**. All it's going to cost you is $0.00 (literally nothing at all, other than your electricity and internet bills).
