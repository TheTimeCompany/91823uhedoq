- 05 June: Domains acquired from [Spaceship.com](https://www.spaceship.com/).
- 06 June: New layout implemented for the personal website.
- 07 June: Prepared and published ['Sun of a Beach'](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sun-of-a-beach-dewan-mukto/1145724270). Modified the MuxDay Discord bot into **Dolly**. Uploaded a simple webfront for the new Muxday website for now.
- 08 June: Polished up the Muxday website UI. Tried to redesign [Honeyfeed](https://www.honeyfeed.fm/)'s UI but failed. Made many Github repos private. Switched to Netlify DNS for the Muxday website.
- 09 June: Added new `serverinfo` feature to **Dolly**. Created a **Wifi Checker** app for Windows and Ubuntu. Experimented with Discord webhooks with Python and Java.
- 10 June: Very unproductive day.
- 11 June: Another unproductive day. Used ChatGPT for a C program that sends URL requests, a Pygame template, and a stock management software in Python. All unfinished.
- 12 June: Unproductive day again. Only proofread through CB classic's new edition (draft) and transferred 'Money Grabbing' to MS Word.
- 13 June: Unproductive day due to exam preparation for the next day.
- 14 June: Unproductive day. Played games instead.

- 18 June: Unproductive day.
- 19 June: Unproductive day.

- 21 June: Started work on **Broken PvP Game** via Roblox Studio. Created a basic map with animated borders. Added randomly transforming barriers, player-facing statues, etc. Made a [1-minute trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl9zaHjLn5c).
- 22 June: Made another game based on the ['Laser Tag' template](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/new-laser-tag-studio-template/3033810) launched today. Turned it into **Concra** with a capture-the-flag game mode.
- 23 June: Added Cooper Black as an enemy NPC to the **Broken PvP Game**.
- 24 June: Fixed the CB NPC's 'dumbness'. Got rid of all template-based scripts. Added new health GUI and killfeed GUI (but doesn't work yet). Added menu intro. Uploaded [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjG5cFfmRWM).
- 25 June: Added a gun info GUI, a main menu (intro) screen, some more NPCs and an automated system of spawning them depending on the number of players in the server. Tried to fix the killfeed GUI but without any success. Mobile devices have their movement controls stuck for some reason.
- 26 June: Fixed the killfeed GUI but the `WeaponImage` uses a placeholder arrow. Mobile controller also fixed; error caused by interactable frame of the killfeed GUI. Most stable version "10" as of now. Uploaded [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoRoFgKfLT4).
- 27 June: Began making custom maps with modular assets. Incomplete. Meanwhile, 3 new maps added: small city, big city, desert. Made NPCs not attack own faction. Minor glitches in the main menu and random map loader (part of the update today).
- 28 June: Been 1 week since continuous work on **Broken PvP Game** began. Tried to add cars and rocket buggies with a remote spawner; failed. Added map and music credit GUI. Added more NPCs. Added "Time Played" (in minutes) leaderboard GUI. The `TimePlayed` is stored via DataStores. Added more background music.
- 29 June: Added map voting system, XP system, ranks, and round timer countdown. Also added a C-130 aircraft model for a 'lobby'point in-betweem rounds and map changes. [New video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdyOLyd1wls) available, too.
- 30 June: Fixed the XP system bug. Added buttons for 'Credits' and 'Shop' in the main menu. Shop not ready yet. Fixed the auto teleportation. Improved the shotgun.
