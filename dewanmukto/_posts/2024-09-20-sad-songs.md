Recently I came across this A.I. platform named [Suno](https://suno.com/create) which can generate songs (music, vocals, lyrics) entirely! Most of them sound really good (atleast to me!), way better than I had anticipated, to be honest. Thus, I would like to share some of the songs I "pioneered" via prompts.

Firstly, here are some lyrical videos based on some of my novels:

## In The Wildest Dimensions

And now, to handle the primary topic of this section/post. Throughout the last 20+ years of my life, I had been contemplating about certain concepts, or "philosophies", about life. Quite deep and emotional aspects. Finally thanks to Suno, I was able to turn my feelings and thoughts into songs that can allow anyone to take a stroll in my footsteps, and take a look at pieces of this world that seem very tragic.

# 1) A song about that feeling you get when you are feeling nostalgic, but also sad that you cannot relive your memories again

# 2) A song about losing a friend who'd promised to be together, where even bringing up their memories hurt

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011641547?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Best Friend"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

# 3) A song about growing up too fast, unable to adapt to the real world where everyone has already moved on

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011642080?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Losing Control"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

# 4) A song about memories being lost sometimes, never to recover what you lost

<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011642692?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Lost Memories"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

# 5) A song about the sad fate of life, that one day everything we know, and everyone we care about, will eventually die and/or end

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011643041?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Endless Goodbyes"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

All these years, these thoughts had been alive and running within my mind, enclosed and shaded behind my self-made mask of stoicism and artificial joy. I couldn't express them nor publish them in a suitable format. Here we are now, luckily, a world where artificial intelligence has the power to creatively produce full-length songs with proper tunes and melodies â€” for me, it was a very emotional breakthrough. 'Cause I managed to convert my feelings into proper songs for others to listen. These 5 songs are very important to me, even if no one else would find their implied meanings on the same caliber.

Thank you for listening, although I am unsure if you have had the same perspectives on those motifs as I have. ðŸ¥²
