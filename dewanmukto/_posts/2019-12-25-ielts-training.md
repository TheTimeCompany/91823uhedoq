> *Having scored an overall band of 8.5 on my IELTS exam on December 2019, this fueled my appetite to kickstart a non-profit project that provides free resources for everyone's benefit. I am also writing a book to help people aggressively "rip and tear" down their fears and confusions about IELTS and to help others reach their destinations and to mend IELTS candidates' confidence. A student read this book's manuscript version and victoriously achieved an overall score of 8.0 on February 2021. You can, too!*

## Want to ace the IELTS exam?
Often the answer is to attend classes at a coaching center, blow away plenty of money and then remain heartbroken as you hold the scores below your expectation.

Well, say no more! Here on my IELTS course, you shall be able to harvest your knowledge for the greater good! You shall find reams of advice and techniques of slaughtering the questions one after the other. Good luck, soldier!

> Notes : \
**Got an exam date already fixed?** \
OR
**Are you already experienced with IELTS and are looking for some "flash tips"?** \
Then skip the wait and teleport yourself ahead to the sections marked as 'Tips'. A special section is already reserved for veteran candidates like you! Have a read through the summary of the most important guidelines and techniques. Those sections are meant for people who are running short of time for their final preparations.

I hope you find your fate and skills blossoming on the final exam!

## IELTS Academic
This is the IELTS module you should select if you are willing to take the IELTS exam for a study permit or qualifications for higher studies abroad. And that's exactly what this book is all about!

Please note, dear readers, that there aren't many differences between the IELTS Academic and the IELTS General Training modules. It will be explained in the upcoming sections (so don't panic if any of the terms are unfamiliar to you!). Just hang on tight and relax.

I still haven't written a separate book for the General Training (GT) module yet. Meanwhile, this Academic module's guidance closely matches the requirements for either modules.

## Intro : What is IELTS ?
Whoa, whoa! Stop right there. Place brakes on your cautious mind and let us start where it all began.

Take a deep breath. Imagine this is the first day you're hearing about IELTS.

International English Language Testing System

Yes, that's right! The big word hovering above this current sentence is the full form of IELTS. The so-called exam on English proficiency is nothing but a simple collection of words placed together to form up a flashy acronym.

An international education organization based in Melbourne, Australia called IDP (International Development Program) apparently co-founded IELTS. They are such monsters, right? Why make such a difficult exam that pumps tension and stress into your life?

Well, to be honest, there are a variety of English proficiency examinations available other than IELTS. But it turns out that IELTS is globally famous and recognized. Especially when people score high bands, they receive a certain degree of prestige from their neighbours (British spelling: "neighbours", American spelling: "neighbors"), friends and family.

Thus, here we all are, prey to the predators of the education systems.

And have no worries! You shall definitely become one of those prestigious candidates with an excellent band score on their result sheet! Trust me. Trust yourself.

Have faith.

Now, take a sip of coffee (or tea, whichever you prefer) as you turn to the next page. We're going to train up like soldiers. And fight the language problems bravely.

What about those words in bold above? Well, in case you have any difficulties in understanding certain words that may be unfamiliar or new to you, I have placed a support section at the end of every page/chapter. So that you can reap the benefits of learning new words to add to your vocabulary!

> Glossary \
proficiency : a high degree of skill; expertise \
acronym : an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word (e.g. PC, NASA ). \
prestige : widespread respect and admiration felt for someone or something on the basis of a perception of their achievements or quality. \
reap : to harvest something / receive (something, especially something beneficial) as a consequence of one's own or another's actions. \
vocabulary : the body of words used in a particular language / *in general,* "vocabulary" *refers to the whole collection of words that you know about a particular language. Also sometimes referred to as \*'lexical resource'. \
perception : the ability to see, hear, or become aware of something through the five senses.

## IELTS Sections 

First and foremost, you should be acquainted with the superficial layout of the IELTS exam. That is, what are the tests and what are they based on.

IELTS has 2 modules (or 'modes'). *Academic* and *General Training* (also known as '*GT*'). Both have 4 sections comprising up the so-called IELTS exam. The Academic module is perfect for students seeking higher education in distant lands and the GT one is fine-tuned for adults and people who wish to get a spouse visa for travelling and staying abroad.

Section 1 is the *Listening* test. To be rather fair and honest, this section is basically an opportunity to eavesdrop on peoples' conversations, like a spy. Yes. You can imagine that the IELTS exam requires you to become a stealthy spy for a day!

Section 2 is the *Reading* test. This is an easy and familiar type of exam faced by everyone in their student life. Don't be afraid of the lengthy articles! You'll soon learn about the softer truth behind the bars of strict guidelines.

Section 3 is the *Writing* test. This part of the exam may be kind of tedious and hard wearing for most people. But not you. You'll be one of the people who can bravely face it off stress-free.

Section 4 is the *Speaking* test. Ironically, the easiest section of IELTS is also the one where people lose marks. Why? Because they were not prepared. They were not calm or cool enough. Stress broke them down.

Are you tensed right now? Will this same tragedy happen to you?

Say "No" (say it!).

Say "No, I will not suffer like that."

Consider this as an oath to yourself. As you move onto the next page.

> Glossary \
acquainted : *it is the past participle of* 'acquaint', *which means* 'make someone aware of or familiar with'. \
superficial : existing or occurring at or on the surface, like a very basic level, without close inspection. \
eavesdrop : secretly listen to a conversation.

## IELTS Module differences
So you've heard of the two modules, yes. What are their differences?

Well, here is where you shall grasp a little more detail.

![diagram showing the differences visually](https://img.wattpad.com/8ebe5f0cb929da1122da66cc6cf47524941c7a61/68747470733a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f776174747061642d6d656469612d736572766963652f53746f7279496d6167652f68766c48766170515079414b6c773d3d2d313036333437383634302e313637616231393637383063373763303836393530393738383938392e706e67?s=fit&w=1280&h=1280)

As it is observable from the timeline diagram above, the 'Listening' and 'Speaking' tests are the same throughout both modules. The prime difference arises when comparing the modules' 'Reading' and 'Writing' tests.

Also, it is obvious that the Academic module is more difficult than the General one by some degree, since it is aimed at students and scholars.

Once again, here is a recap of the 2 modules :

**IELTS Academic**

This is the IELTS module you should select if you are willing to take the IELTS exam for a study permit or qualifications for higher studies abroad.

**IELTS General Training**

This is the IELTS module you should select if you are willing to take the IELTS exam for a visa abroad or applying for permanent citizenship.

## Section 1: Listening
What is it about?

An audio recording is played in the background. You take notes. You answer some questions relating to the recordings and conversations you just heard, like comprehension. As simple as that.

You'll be given a question sheet and an answer sheet. While the recording is being played, there are instructions in the recording as well. You're allowed to note down as many things as you like on the question sheet (along with the answers ofcourse!).

How many questions?

There are 40 questions in the Listening test. And as you already know, the Listening test is same for all modules.

The main 'Listening' test consists of 30 minutes. You should write down your answers in the question sheet first. DO NOT write them down directly into the answer sheet.

At the end of the 30 minutes, the recording stops with a final instruction that you should now transfer your answers to the answer sheet. Only then, you can peacefully begin to write down the answers there.

How is it graded?

A rather cruel criterion, I should say. The grades are in the order of 9 to 1, with 9 being the best grade and 1 being the worst. If there is nothing to mark at all, you score a 0. Haha. Don't panic. That would be the case if you were absent on the exam date, that is.

Out of the 40 questions, getting 39-40 correct scores a 9... 37-38 scores a 8.5... 35-36 scores a 8... 33-34 scores a 7.5... and so on.

Once again, do not be frightened by the strict circumstances and the narrow gaps in the grading scheme. The makers of IELTS exactly want that. To make their candidates shudder and shiver in fear! Thus, do not let them trick you into fear and stress.

Believe in yourself. Have confidence.

Take another sip of coffee/tea before moving on.

## Reading, Writing and Speaking sections
Since this is an online course, it is dynamic. Sorry to say, sufficient time wasn't available in my inventory. Fear not! I shall add in more detailed sections for the remaining 3 sections/tests soon.

Till then, have a skim through the "Tips" sections ahead.

## Listening Tips
Section 1 : Listening

TIME PROVIDED : 30 mins + 10 mins

4 sections (increasing difficulty with every section)

Section A contains a conversation between 2 people.\
Section B usually contains only one person speaking , e.g. a tour guide.\
Section C usually contains a group discussion, e.g. a class or work discussion.\
Section D usually contains only person explaining something, e.g. giving a lecture.

1\. Right from the start of every section, before the recording even starts, it is wise to read the questions of that section very carefully. You can then follow the pace of the recording more fluently and can locate the answers efficiently.

2\. After finishing a section, a good tactic is to focus on the upcoming section's questions than worrying about the previous section.

3\. Sometimes, there shall be a list of choices/options to choose your answer. The arrangement of the answers are not strictly in the order you will hear them in the recording. Instead, they are likely to be arranged in alphabetical order.

4\. Watch out for word limits! If a question has an instruction "Write no more than two words", then writing more than two words violates the rule and you will receive NO MARKS at all for your answer (even if some words were correct for the answer).

5\. Try to listen for key words or synonyms (words that have the same or almost the same meaning as another word) from the question to help you find the answer. For example, in the recording, you may hear "*She likes going to the gym and playing tennis.*" On your answer sheet, this could appear as "*She is an active person.*"

6\. You may be asked to write down words that have been spelled out in the recording. In order to do this well, you need to know the English alphabet and how each letter is pronounced.

7\. Just to be safe, it's best to write down anything that is spelt in the recording.

8\. While you're listening to the recording, cross out the options that don't fit. This makes it easier for you to identify the right answer.

9\. If you are writing dates as an answer to any question, it is okay to write them in any order. For example, "22nd April", "April 22", and "22 April" are all correct.

10\. If there are questions which you cannot answer, leave them there. Move onto the next question. This will help you to stay calm and positive.

11\. Go back to those questions at the end... if you have time.

## Reading Tips
Section 2 : Reading

TIME PROVIDED : 1 hour

3 passages with random order of difficulty, e.g. Passage 1 could be most difficult than the others.

1\. No extra time for transferring answers. So write down answers to sheet. Use the question paper for rough work.

2\. This section is all about a variety of comprehension question types.

3\. To improve your performance in the Reading test, you need to practise reading a variety of English texts. This will help you develop the ability to read quickly.

4\. Read every question carefully first before reading the passages. So you know exactly which pieces of information to find.

5\. Underline possible answers as you go.

6\. When you come to reading the passage, read it quickly ("skim read") in the first attempt, enough to get a 50% understanding about the text.

7\. Don't worry about words you don't understand.

8\. Then read each question again to remind yourself which parts of the passage you will need to read again in detail.

9\. There is no need to think that you need extra knowledge for any question.

10\. The passages will contain all the information you need to answer the question. You won't have to use any general knowledge of a topic.

11\. If you are asked to label a diagram, you will find the words you need in the text.

12\. Be sure to copy the words carefully from the passage with the correct spelling.

13\. If there are questions which you cannot answer, leave them there. Move onto the next question. This will help you to stay calm and positive.

14\. Go back to those questions at the end... if you have time.

## Writing Tips
Section 3 : Writing

TIME PROVIDED : 15 mins + 45 mins

There are 2 tasks :

Task 1

Diagram/Map summary

OR

Chart/Graph summary

Task 2

Argumentative essay (e.g. "Agree or disagree....")

OR

Opinion-based essay (e.g. "Do you believe....")

OR

Discussion essay (e.g. "Discuss....")

A general guidance for a standard essay format :

1st paragraph : Introduction (2 lines)

2nd and 3rd paragraphs : main body (5-7 lines)

4th paragraph : conclusion (1 line)

1\. There are no right or wrong answers or opinions. The examiners are assessing how well you can use your English to report information and express ideas.

2\. The ONE question the examiners are asking themselves when checking your answer is : "Does this person know how to write an essay in English?"

3\. Analyze questions carefully to make sure your answer contains all the points covered by the question.

4\. Be careful to use your own words by "paraphrasing", because the examiner will not include words copied from the question in the word count.

5\. You don't have to write very long sentences to do well. If your sentences are too long, they will become less coherent and also make it harder for you to control the grammar.

6\. In Task 1, you only have to select and compare relevant information from the data presented in a table, graph, chart.

7\. Once again, a kind reminder : do not copy words from the question. Use your own words.

8\. You shouldn't try to interpret (explain) or give reasons for any data!

9\. In Task 2, don't forget to plan your essay before starting. (The whole 250 words essay can be done in just 30 minutes, trust me!) Take 5-10 minutes for planning.

10\. Support your answer with real-life examples (called "anecdotes").

11\. Write the conclusion as a paraphrasing of the introduction. Or simply write it based on the most important information you provided in the body paragraphs.

## Speaking tips

Section 4 : Speaking

TIME PROVIDED : 15-20 mins

There are 3 parts for this section/test.

Part 1 : Interview

All about yourself! Don't feel shy!

Part 2 : Cue Card Speech

Talk for 2 minutes (until examiner stops you).

The topic will be based on a card handed to you.

Part 3 : Discussion

Longer duration of talking about personal opinions on the cue card topic you got.

1\. Practise speaking in English everywhere! With friends, at work, on the phone, etc.

2\. You can consider recording yourself with a phone or tape recorder. Play it to judge yourself.

3\. Be confident that you can allow yourself to be recorded in the actual exam day.

4\. There are no right or wrong answers or opinions. The examiners are assessing how well you can express your ideas and opinions in good English.

5\. It will help you if you imagine you are talking to a friend. Remember that you are not being assessed on your opinions... only on your use of English.

6\. Avoid repeating words that are used in the examiner's question. Use your own words to show the examiner your full ability!

7\. Speak clearly and at a natural pace (speed). If you speak too fast, you may make mistakes or pronounce words incorrectly.

8\. Be cautious (careful) about the tense (past/present/future) used in the questions.

9\. Practise pronunciation of numbers. For example, some numbers can sound very similar when spoken, e.g. "thirty" and "thirteen", "forty" and "fourteen", "fifty" and "fifteen", etc.

10\. Don't simply say "Yes, I do" or "No, I don't". Answer in as much detail as you can.

11\. Give examples from your own experience -- this will develop your answers.

12\. Try to answer as fully as possible and give reasons for your answers. This will help you to use a wider range of vocabulary and grammar.

13\. Lastly, DO NOT STOP OR PAUSE!!

14\. If you need to pause, try to use some clever and stylish methods, e.g. "Well, I haven't thought about it for a long time, but I think I would say...."

15\. The trick above will allow you to show the examiner that you are not pausing for searching words. Instead, try to show him/her that you are simply "thinking" about the topic.

## Choosing the exam centre
"British Council" OR "IDP"

Both exam centers offer the same fees and the same conditions and rules. There is no difference between them.\
Registration can be done from your coaching center (if applicable).

OR

From the exam center

OR

Online (from the British Council or IDP website, for example)

This is it, dear people! I hope this book helps you embrace your goals!!

*All the best!*
