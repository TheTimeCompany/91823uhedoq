This concept had been bothering my mind for the past couple of months, but I couldn't spare myself enough time and patience to write it down somewhere. This is a personal theory upon how our local environments can play a major role in affecting our racial characteristics in the long term.

Basically, I believe there is a connection between the **climate** we are born in and how our bodies **have been adapted** to optimize our lifestyles in that region. Say, for example, people living near the colder **Arctic latitudes** (in Europe or North America) are more gentle, chill and smarter than those near the **equator** (in Africa or South Asia). This is **not** a case of racism. This is a case of **genetics** and **long term adaptations**! Naturally, the bodies of people living in cooler climates need more heat - which they get via additional blood circulation throughout their bodies, especially their brains. This results in **enhanced mental capabilities** for that demographic. The coolness of the weather also helps them remain **more relaxed** with their lives than the warmer climate counterparts.

On the other hand, people in **hot weather** tend to be more easy-to-anger, **impatient**, lazier, etc. This can be explained by the preset temperature being already so high, for which any sort of muscle movement or labour would bring forth **more heat**; to prevent our bodies from overheating, our brains have been pre-configured to have a **lower performance** and our bodies try to move **less frequently** - taking as many steps as possible to **reduce heat** generating within our body.

If you would like to see this effect in action, just try being "generous" (by doing some task worthy of displaying kindness or otherwise) in a cold country (e.g. Canada) and then in a warm country (e.g. Bangladesh) and you'll be able to **understand the differences**.

Although this theory would need actual scientific (statistical) evidence, for the moment it is logical enough to draw the aforementioned conclusions.
