Hello again, netizens of the internetwork! 👋

Today we are here to bring forth an AMAZING news - we are currently offering landing pages for people. That's right! Those link-in-bio webpages found on peoples' profiles on Instagram, Twitter, Discord, etc. that contains a set of all their links to other social platforms and projects they're upto.

Would you like to have your own?

If you're reading this article, you probably have already tried building your own using [Bio.link](http://bio.link/), [Carrd.co](http://carrd.co/), [Linktr.ee](http://linktr.ee/) or some other alternative. How did you feel? Obstructed by the limitations of their free tier, I believe?

Oh, you poor soul. 🥺 The problem isn't your wallet. The problem is "not being at the right place at the right time".

So here we are! Presenting to you...

Link-in-bio Pages for Individuals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost: $0 forever!

Unlike other competitors, we do not care about automation and the sheer digitalization (dehumanization). That's why we don't shove an online editor at your face which later cracks open into a paywall like a jack-in-a-box surprise!

Wev.ovh connects you to a real person, where you can describe your design ideas, styles, theme, color choices, etc. alongside your handful of links to post up. Whether you prefer the convenience of a text message over Discord, an email, or a video/audio call - we're ready!

And yes, by all means, we shall not need any personal info at all. Nor any credit card details. 😂

Here follows a list of the features we promise:

-   Responsive Design - your landing page shall be adaptive to the device's screen size and shape, ensuring that it always looks charming and in the way you expect!

-   100% Free - the free trial isn't like other free trials. Ours can last forever! And no credit card is required either, unlike certain businesses who prefer to pick your pockets when you're not looking.

-   Full Customization - simply describe whatever you want, and we'll deliver! Within reasonable reasons, ofcourse! Anything that fits a landing page. (so don't end up asking for a "blogging" feature.)

-   Analytics - not enabled by default, but if you're a statistics-conscious person, you can request to have access to the info about your visitors, discovery streams, etc. via [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). Simply send us the "embed code" snippet and we'll add it! And if you're not familiar, we'll teach you. Everything's quite easy once you know the correct terminology.

-   Content Embeds - if you ever feel like embedding something (if you see an "Embed </>" button) from a social platform or website, just send us the code and we'll place it in!

-   Unlimited Access - Unlike other free alternatives, we don't place a "monthly limit" to the number of visitors. Even if a billion people connect to the website simultaneously, it's our responsibility to make sure they all can!

-   Shop Embeds - want to monetize your traffic? Set up a store and embed products right on your landing page! We recommend Ecwid for physical products and Gumroad for digital products.

-   Verifications - who doesn't love that blue badge with a ✔️ mark? If you can prove that you own the social platforms that you link, we'll provide one on your landing page for free!

-   SEO - search engine optimization. Fancy term for planning out websites and content in such a way that they become easily discoverable on search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, etc.) when people search for a particular term, phrase or name.

-   Custom Domain - if you already have your own domain, we can hook it right up! You can also contact us for purchasing a [custom domain](https://blog.wev.ovh/domains).

-   Free Subdomain - if you don't wish to purchase a domain and if you currently don't have one of your own, then no worries! Your landing page can be accessible from either wev.ovh/l/yourname or yourname.wev.ovh.

-   Fast Loading - time is precious, and according to psychological research, first impressions count! Thus, you can remain confident that your landing page will rapidly load within 1 second.

-   Bot Protection - in case you are targetted by a toxic script kiddie who's harassing your landing page with bots to attempt a DDoS attack, have no fear! We can instantly activate the "shields" via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

Ofcourse, the best examples are which you can see with your own eyes. So here are a few example landing pages made by us for free!

-   Landing page for a Canadian music producer 🎵 [wev.ovh/l/ftnx](https://wev.ovh/l/ftnx)

-   Landing page for a Bangladeshi graphic designer 🎨 [wev.ovh/l/unico](https://wev.ovh/l/unico)

-   Landing page for a Filipino VR gamer 🎮 [gabdodd.wev.ovh](https://gabdodd.wev.ovh/)

Hint: our landing pages can be configured to look different in different devices (if clients want). Try visiting each of the links above on a phone as well as a PC/laptop.

Depending on the allocation of your financial resources, Wev.ovh shall be determined to set ours, too.

Sample information that might be inquired in the video interview shall include, but not be limited to:
