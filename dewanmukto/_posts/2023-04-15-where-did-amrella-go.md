Greetings!

If you were one of the early beta testers of Kodbell (Amrella) back in October 2020, then we are sorry to announce that the main site has fallen. The platform service and hosting provider Tribe no longer offers a free tier plan for our technical requirements. Thus, this here is a substitute platform while we work on bringing back the original (or better) version.

Hopefully, Amrella will be fully launched no later than 2038 and no sooner than 2026.

Till then, take care and stay tuned!

Take your time to review the [Terms and Conditions](https://amrella.wev.ovh/terms-of-service "Terms of Service") and [Privacy Policy](https://amrella.wev.ovh/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy") for this new (temporary) platform.

And also feel free to purchase some items from the [Shop](https://dmistore.gumroad.com/ "Shop") to provide funding for us!

Thanks.
