Hey there fellow netizen ðŸ‘‹

I believe you are looking for a free domain to host your project. Or maybe use it for your CDN?

Whatever your purposes might be, as long as they're within reasonable ethics and legal regulations, you can feel free to contactÂ [domains@wev.ovh](http://mailto:domains@wev.ovh/)Â to claim your free subdomain.

Sample use cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Connect withÂ GitHub PagesÂ to shorten theÂ [.github.io](#)Â toÂ .wev.ovhÂ instead.

-   Connect withÂ Cloudflare PagesÂ to shorten theÂ .pages.devÂ toÂ .wev.ovh.

-   Connect withÂ GumroadÂ to shorten theÂ [.gumroad.com](#)Â toÂ .wev.ovh.

-   Connect withÂ ReplitÂ to use a custom domain instead ofÂ *project*.*user*[.repl.co](#).

-   Connect with Hashnode to shorten theÂ .hashnode.devÂ toÂ .wev.ovh.

Why it matters
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain countries offer second-level domains appended by their ccTLDs that are just 1-letter shorten than a wev.ovh domain. Yet, do you think it's worth the cost for simply using the domain for a fun idea?

-   AÂ [.info.bd](#)Â is as long asÂ .wev.ovhÂ but barely costs anything unlike the former, which stands at about $0.80 per year.

-   AÂ .wev.ovhÂ domain costs nothing while aÂ [.com.au](#)Â domain is around $9 per year. That's over $720 spanning your lifetime!

Surely, if your website is meant to be used for a business-oriented purpose, then spending $12 annually for a standard .com domain sounds like a very feasible task. But here atÂ Wev.ovh, our vision is to help out developers from countries whose own domestic currency is very weak against the US dollar. And due to unfairly high exchange rates, even a tiny $10 a year (that's less than $1 per month) seems like a pricey luxury for certain demographics (e.g. teenagers in India who do not have an allowance fit for purchasing domains on their own).

Is it worth it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's make one fact clear: You'll be receiving aÂ *subdomain*Â instead of a normalÂ *domain*. It's basically the same thing except you won't have access to the DNS records. If you ever need to update/add/edit the DNS records pertaining to your registered "domain" withÂ Wev.ovh, then you simply contactÂ [dns-manager@wev.ovh](http://mailto:dns-manager@wev.ovh/).
