This planet is the heart of the main storyline of Knightspeak. It has a lot in common with the Earth we know of in the real world except for its size and physics.

Basic characteristics
=====================

The cycle of day and night is brought on by the revolution of the Sun and the Moon, situated at the edges of Dano, the realm in which Emen is situated. Emen itself is a stationary celestial object in space. As for the seasons, an invisible shell covering the atmosphere is responsible for the differences.

The northern regions are cooler and the southern are warmer.

Continents
==========

Three main landmasses (continents) are where life had settled over the years. Among them, the largest one is Emetria (sometimes called Emenecoria, as well) which is considered to be the 'mainland in the middle' by convention. Selecting this as a center, to its west lies the continent of Fononia, also known as Calemarn by its first line of settlers. And to its east lies Dovaak, although the eastern portion is largely unexplored.

Three main landmasses (continents) are where life had settled over the years. Among them, the largest one is Emetria (sometimes called Emenecoria, as well) which is considered to be the 'mainland in the middle' by convention. Selecting this as a center, to its west lies the continent of Fononia, also known as Calemarn by its first line of settlers. And to its east lies Dovaak, although the eastern portion is largely unexplored.

Emetria has a mixed range of climates ranging from temperate grasslands and peaceful monsoons, to biting cold in its northernmost kingdoms. The whole continent is divided up into kingdoms under rulers respective to each region, e.g. Azgamdore, Stratomdore, Uzbokai, Milanopal, etc. Most of the common races dwell and live in Emetria, including humans, orcs, goblins, trolls and elves.

The origins of the first civilizations were in Stratomdore (humans), Elphis (high elves), Uzbokai (orcs), Mukhotin (dwarves), and Gitt (giants). However, as time crawled past, lesser races emerged from other continents and realms. The greater races collided in warfare, too. Especially for the goal of supremacy.

To the south lies Bellarog, a continent basking in an intense heatwave. Although no races originated from it, some types of orcs and dwarves have been sighted. They have adapted themselves to the searing temperatures brought on by proximity to several cracks in Emen's surface.

As for the West and East and North, information about them will be posted in separate pages to ensure safety from spoiler content while reading the story.
