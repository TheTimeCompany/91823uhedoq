"[In The Wildest Dimensions](/books/itwd)" is a mystery/thriller novel, fueled by dark fantasy and romance, by Dewan Mukto under the pseudonym of his mascot, Distil. The tale begins with a detective on vacation who discovers a strange set of events that leads him to ultimately question his entire existence. ITWD is a story of memory loss and trust, and how truth is often warped in ways we don't understand.
