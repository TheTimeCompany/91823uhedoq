Hey there!

Yesterday, while searching for a new smartphone in Bangladesh, I realized that we could just purchase the individual components from some foreign manufacturer or OEM supplier and then proceed to building our own phones the way people build their own PCs!

For this article, it is being assumed that you are familiar with how to handle basic circuit engineering procedures, since you are expected to already own certain equipment, e.g. soldering iron, for which the capital costs are not being accounted for. Furthermore, it is being taken into consideration that there are no labour costs and you are doing everything by yourself, "DIY". And ofcourse, you are expected to already be acquainted with a local hardware dealer or a Chinese exporter to keep the costs lower.

**Why would you want to build your own phone(s)?** Well, it could be any of the following reasons:
- practice manufacturing electronics as part of an EEE or CSE academic project
- build and design your own "merch" device with custom logos, colors, etc.
- start a side hustle selling phones and gaining publicity (and profits)
- impress your friends with your awesome skills
- build decoy devices for testing purposes

Alright then, let's head on with the list of parts we would need to build each type of device:

# Budget Phone
This smartphone is meant for those who are not familiar with how to use Android devices yet (toddlers, senior elders, etc.) and are willing to give it a try. The hardware specifications are certainly not sufficient for a modern-day experience of what a smartphone can accomplish! Rather, it is simply a phone for people who are on a tight budget.
