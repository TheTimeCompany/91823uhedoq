App UI concept for Gemini a well-known fraudulent "stock trading" app that is supposed to make people rich. But in fact, it does not. Thus, I decided to imagine what the Gemini app would have looked like if it actually was genuine and legitimate.

Please note, the marketing copy is fake and for parody purposes only.
