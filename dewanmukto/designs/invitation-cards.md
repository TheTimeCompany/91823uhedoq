Recently, a client reached out to me on Instagram for ordering a birthday invitation card, due to the lack of the time necessary for the client to design it themselves, or to pay a professional.

Given the situation at hand, I had generated 4 variations of the card based on the constraints provided:

**Shape:** Bracket

**Size:** 3.5 x 4.875 inches

**Preferred Color:** Redwood

**Design style:** Floral

Let me know what you think! 😁 I am relatively new to the trade of graphic design, so I am really excited to receive feedback - no matter how sweet or brutal.

In case you are looking for someone who can design invitation cards for you (birthday, wedding, event, etc.) I am your man! 😎

**Feel free to reach out to me to discuss about the project.**
