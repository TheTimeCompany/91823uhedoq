![Custom landing page for Unico](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/10894594/screenshots/19622554/media/2f87efc0141aea0b41250f876f2d128b.png?resize=400x300&vertical=center)

There's a particular graphics designer that I admire, named Unico (available as [Unico101](https://dribbble.com/unico101)) on Dribbble.

I noticed he was using [liinks.co](https://liinks.co/unico) for his "landing page". Given the limited number of features available on that link-in-bio website builder, I thought he needs a 'boost' on the technical side.

So I decided to lend a hand!

Rather than rely on visual designing tools, I hard-coded the entire layout of the website from scratch. This was quite a fun experience for me to explore how CSS can be manipulated to achieve the desired effects. Furthermore, to add a cherry to the top of our little UI cake, I configured it to show separate versions of the website - depending on the platform (mobile, PC) viewed upon.

The full source of the website is available on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/distil/pen/BaxvpOX).
