**Mario's**Â is a fictional clothing brand that aims at selling weather-influential apparel to people of all ages and sizes. EspeciallyÂ **water-proof and winterÂ clothing**.

Nowadays, people have a very short attention span in general, thus, theÂ **Mario's**Â app reduces distractions and only provides a visual-first approach. On its homescreen, theÂ **current/upcoming season**'s products are highlighted, followed by theÂ **highest-purchasing demographic customers**Â (men), right above theÂ **Trending ðŸ”¥**Â category.

Naturally, customers are interested in discovering the products which areÂ **currently on sale**Â or at aÂ **clearance era**. Thus, a specific section on the menu panel links directly to a section that lists all the products which have a discount on them.

Each product has its ownÂ **dedicated page**Â listing all of its attributes. Additional features include a color palette tool and a convincingÂ **marketing copy**Â resting right beneath the main facts of the item.

TheÂ **Mario's**Â app saves customers' payment methods, ensuring they are always ready to buy. TheÂ **order summary screen**Â lists the important facts about each item and concludes with a thematic total amount due.

Even after a purchase has been made,Â **Mario's**Â offers customers the gift ofÂ transparency to let themÂ **keep a track of their order**Â for every step till the parcel has arrived right at their doorstep. Although not shown here, theÂ **Track Order**Â button is expected to bring up a map displaying the exact location of the products even if they still haven't left the warehouse!
