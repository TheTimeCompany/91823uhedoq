**Fortenox**Â is a rising CanadianÂ **musical producer**Â andÂ **DJ**Â (and a trusted friend of mine!)

This is just aÂ **visual representation of a new website**Â that I have proposed forÂ [Fortenox](https://www.youtube.com/@Fortenox/videos). There will be additional sections, too. The code for the website will be available onÂ [Codepen](https://codepen.io/distil)Â once I have produced the "wireframe" base for it.

**Thanks for checking it out!**Â This design may not be perfect, but I am open for feedback to learn more! ðŸ˜„

Also take a look at a slightly alternate version of thisÂ [landing page design on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/182194675/Website-for-Fortenox).
